# SPICOMP: The Sampling-based Pixel Contingency Formation Planning Algorithm

These are the source codes of the pixel contingency formation algorithm we described in the paper entitled "Contingency Formation Planning in Interactive Drone Light Shows" that was submitted to ICRA 2025. The source code also includes a simulator of drone light shows for the evaluation of the algorithm. The codes of the algorithms can be found in spicomp_simulator.h and spicomp_simulator.cpp. The codes of the simulator can be found in spicomp_gui.h and spicomp_gui.cpp.

This program has been compiled successfully by the Apple Clang 16 compiler on an Apple laptop with an M3 CPU. The program depends on the SDL2 and SDL2_GFX library. You can use the Makefile to compile the program. Then you can run the program with the command "bin_mac/main -g".
